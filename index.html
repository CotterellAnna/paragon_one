                    With the advent of remote internships, Gen Z high schoolers have the ability to differentiate
                     themselves by gaining corporate work experience to boost their college applications, even as 
                     COVID19 delays their higher education plans.

                    With health concerns, travel restrictions and recent anti-immigration proposals, it is

                <p class="text">
                    ‍Fewer than 20% of undergraduates reach out to their school’s career centers for advice on 
                    finding jobs or identifying and applying to graduate programs. While the role of career 
                    centers has been evolving for some years now, 2020 has made it very clear that they need to 
                    think well beyond putting internship postings on the school job portal in order to truly 
                    contribute value.
